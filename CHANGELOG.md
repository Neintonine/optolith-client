### API

There are important and breaking changes coming with the next release, so if you use the Optolith source or save data, I'd recommend to come over to [Discord](https://discord.gg/wfdgB9g) so that I can tell you what is going to be changed in detail. Since more and more people depend on Optolith's data I will now follow semantic versioning strictly so that you can rely on the compatibility of source files just by checking out the version number. There will be a new format for heroes as well as for the source data. You can also give feedback on the changes, since they are not *completely* done yet &ndash; but I still think it would make sense to check out the changes as early as possible. The next major version is still a bit away, so you'll have plenty of time to adjust your software.

## 1.1.0/[1.1.1](https://github.com/elyukai/optolith-client/compare/v1.0.3...v1.1.1)/[1.1.2](https://github.com/elyukai/optolith-client/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2) (2018-08-06)

*The exact version number of the app is 1.1.2.*

After more than one year a big update is finally comingâeven though you probably wonât notice it: Optolith got a completely new code. This is accompanied by an internal restructuring, so that features like groups will be possible in the future. This is the biggest change, but not the only one: All reported bugs are fixed and over the last two weeks my testers found several bugs, which are also fixed here.

You will probably notice that Optolith takes a few seconds longer to load than before. This is because I rebuilt Optolith with the basic idea that it runs more stable. So I do checks during loading to make sure that all data that is loaded really looks as expected and so that nothing unexpected and unintentional, caused by wrong tables or other wrong data in the program, happens. The start performance is definitely going to be improved, but for now I prefer a more stable program to a fast one; after all this is only about starting the program, the performance during use is not affected.

Last but not least a big thank you to you, for your patience and all your feedback and further help, without which I would not have been able to fix all those bugs. Although new rules have not yet made it into this version, and the next version wonât contain all new ones, Optolith will be able to get up to date more quickly than before.

But now itâs time for the changelog of this version:

### New Features

- Heroes can now be saved from the hero list.
- Avatars of heroes and pets can now be deleted.

### Enhancements

- Select option lists are now filtered by activated books. Previously, that only worked for main lists like special abilities, but now it works for all list, for example the list of trade secrets.

- Shields on character sheet are now listed as a weapon as well as a shield.
- Wiki texts are now selectable.
- For *Tradition (Guild Mage)*, you need to set a specific unfamiliar spell. **For an already activated SA, you can to the via the *Rules* tab. Please set the spell, because it is needed for upcoming books!**
- To be able to better handle differences between languages in terms of rules, heroes are now saving the languages they were created in. **For already created heroes, the creation language will be set to the current UI language. To change that, you need to switch to the *Rules* tab! Please check it, because it is going to be relevant in future versions!**
- The term for generating random weight and size of the hero is now shown above the respective input field.
- The dialog shown on application quit if there are unsaved actions is now clearer and shows three buttons for all three possible options.
- Text on character sheet is now selectable. This option is not useful for copying the complete character sheet as the layout is not preserved properly.

- The separate entries for advantage *Exceptional Sense* and disadvantage *Restricted Sense* are now joined.
- *Additional sources* lists sources from which the entry gets its select options. For example, SA *Trade Secrets* not only shows the source for the base SA, but also the different trade secret sources from all the different books.
- Analogous to the Ravenâs Beaks blessed variant, thereâs now a mundane variant available, too. It costs 90 S. Thereâs no difference between the two versions except for *blessed/mundane*.
- For Staff Enchantments, *Binding of the Staff* as a prerequisite is now hidden (because it is hidden in Core Rules, too).

- Lowering attributes in editing mode takes added LP/AE/KP into account and restricts lowering if needed.

- Beim Eintragen von neuen AP nach der Charaktererstellung wird nun Ã¼berprÃ¼ft, ob man nur Zahlen eingibt. Ist es nicht der Fall, weil das Textfeld z.B. Text oder Kommata enthÃ¤lt, kann man den Wert nicht hinzufÃ¼gen.
- Im Gegenstandseditor wird einem nun angezeigt, wenn ein Feld zur Speicherung gefÃ¼llt sein muss oder zur Speicherung keinen kompatiblen Inhalt hat. Was kompatibel ist, sollte jedem eigentlich klar sein (kein Text beim AT-Modifikator etc.), daher habe ich mir die ErlÃ¤uterungen da gespart.
- Merkmalsfokus und Varianten funktionieren jetzt aber wirklich.
- Der Charakterbogen enthÃ¤lt nun auch endlich den Begleiter als Eintrag.

## 0.46.0 (2017-05-02)

- AusgewÃ¤hlte EintrÃ¤ge fÃ¼r SF Variante und SF Merkmalsfokus werden jetzt auch gespeichert.
- Zaubertricks funktionieren jetzt wieder so wie sie sollen.
- Ich habe mit einer Ãbersetzung der UI fÃ¼r den nicht-deutschsprachigen Teil der Community begonnen. Die Sprache wird anhand eures Systems bestimmt und daher auf Deutsch oder Englisch (noch Deutsch+Englisch ^^) eingestellt. Ihr kÃ¶nnt die Sprache festlegen, indem ihr auÃerhalb der Heldenerstellung oben rechts die Einstellungen Ã¶ffnet und dann die Sprache auswÃ¤hlt.
